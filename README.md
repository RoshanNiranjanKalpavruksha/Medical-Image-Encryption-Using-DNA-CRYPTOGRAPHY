Medical Image Encryption Using DNA CRYPTOGRAPHY

This paper proposed a novel cryptographic method for enhancing the security while transmission of image. Image which covers highest percentage of multimedia data, its protection is at most important. In image encryption methodologies, the pixels of original images are either manipulated or information is laid inside the image using the image as a cover to protect the data from undesired receivers. Scope of the project is to ponder on different ways of securing image data. Being a part of this digital world security becomes the toughest and most important things to handle. On the other hand, hacking is also a growing domain which is used to track out a lot of information to solve a lot of digital criminal issues. DNA (Deoxy Ribonucleic acid) molecules, having the capacity to store, process and transmit information, inspires the idea of DNA cryptography. This combination of the chemical characteristics of biological DNA sequences and classical cryptography ensures the non- vulnerable transmission of data. In this paper review has been made about the present state of art of DNA cryptography.
